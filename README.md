## What purple color means?
It means that the tolerable amount of certain nutrient was exceeded
## What about other DRIs?
It is possible to set them, but it is [little harder](https://jedzoka.github.io/plantiet/?c1c1c1c1c1c1c1c1c1c1c1c1c1c1c1c1c1c1c1c1c1c1c1c1c1c1c1c1c1c1c1c1c1c2c2c2c2c2c2c2c2c2c2c2c2c2c2c2c2c2c2c2c2c2c2c2c2c2c2c2c2c2c2c2c2c2c)
## What about other nutrients?
It isn't possible to set them in this distribution of Plantiet. Chromium, Molybdenum and Chloride aren't listed in FDC, that's why they aren't included
## What about [FDC](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/) alternatives?
It isn't possible to set them, you need to [remix](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/plantiet) the project in order to implement them
## Why Plantiet doesn't respond?
It may be because of [rate limits](https://api.data.gov/docs/rate-limits/), wait a little and try again
